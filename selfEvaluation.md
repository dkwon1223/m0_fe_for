# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
    - I feel confident in my understanding and fluency with the for statement including syntax and iterating over arrays using specific conditions and counting variables.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - It felt like a productive struggle and was rewarding to implement my own for statements.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I feel that I just need to practice implementing for statements with challenging examples. I will do this by finding external resources online to practice more problems.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - No questions so far, however if any do arise I will prioritize communication and asking questions to my Turing instructors.
